      <h2>üßë‚Äçüíª Apprentice Overview</h2>
      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I joined Clover as a Support Engineer, where I had the opportunity to work on a wide range of impactful projects. My early responsibilities involved troubleshooting real-world issues in the field, performing deep-dive forensics, and utilizing a variety of tools such as New Relic, Looker, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and more to diagnose and resolve bugs.

        Later in the program, I transitioned into automation, where we focused on testing Android applications using Kotlin and UIAutomator. This hands-on experience allowed me to strengthen my coding skills and gain a deeper understanding of clean code principles and automation frameworks.

        In addition, I worked on cloud-based testing initiatives using Cypress and Playwright, collaborating closely with my team to shift towards an automation-first approach. Together, we significantly improved our test coverage ‚Äî scaling from just 10% to nearly 80% automation coverage on Android in a short timeframe.

        Throughout my apprenticeship, I also had the chance to contribute to various projects, including a full-stack inventory management application and a Kotlin weather app . These projects not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of collaboration and agile methodologies in software development.
        
        This apprenticeship was an incredible learning journey that helped me grow as a developer, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and work effectively in cross-functional teams.</p>
