          <p>
          During the Multiverse bootcamp and throughout the apprenticeship, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to build a strong foundation in software development and grow both technically and professionally.

From the start, I dove deep into core programming concepts including JavaScript, React, backend development with Node.js and Express, relational and non-relational databases (like MySQL and MongoDB), RESTful APIs, and even containerization with Docker. Each module introduced me to new tools, languages, and best practices that expanded my technical toolset.

Beyond the technical skills, I gained hands-on experience working with real production systems, learning how to debug effectively using monitoring and analytics tools, and writing clean, maintainable code. I became comfortable navigating both manual and automated testing environments and saw firsthand how automation improves efficiency and reliability when applied thoughtfully.

Most importantly, I learned how to work collaboratively in agile teams, communicate effectively, and continuously adapt. Whether pair programming, reviewing PRs, or discussing bugs with stakeholders, I learned the value of asking the right questions and staying curious.

These experiences have shaped me into a more confident and capable developer, ready to contribute meaningfully to any team or project.
