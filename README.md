# 💻 Melissa Yefsah – Full Stack Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio website built with React, styled with custom CSS and gradients, and powered by a Node.js + Sequelize backend using SQLite. It showcases all major projects completed during my Multiverse apprenticeship, along with an overview, learning reflection, and contact form.
